# RPM Development  
  
 This repo will be used for RPM Development  
  
[All RPM are built on Fedora COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/casjay/)  
And are also build internally @ CasjaysDev build systems. The build systems run  
on VMS and get pushed to [sourceforge.net/p/rpm-devel](https://sourceforge.net/p/rpm-devel/).
The main repo will be at [rpm-devel.sourceforge.io/repo/](https://rpm-devel.sourceforge.io/repo/) and will contain the lastest rpms.  
All sources can be found on both [GitHub](https://github.com/CasjaysDev/rpm-devel) and [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/rpm-devel/_list/git)
